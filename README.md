This project implements a comprehensive Graph class, allowing for the creation, traversal, and modification of a directed graph structure. The program supports operations such as adding and deleting vertices and edges, as well as performing depth-first and breadth-first searches to explore the graph's connectivity. The adjacency matrix representation facilitates efficient graph manipulation and visualization of changes made to the structure.
